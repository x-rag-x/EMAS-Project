## 🔹 `v2.3.1` — 24 August 2026 *(Features Implementation)*

### *General Changes & Updates*
- Implementation of **Selector HTML** file for teacher login. Sub-Admin features and whole admin feature access updated and linked with teacher portal. Teacher with `adminRights` can have access to admin featured pages via `selector.html`.
- Added personal `defaultAttendanceStatus` (`Present`/`Absent`/`Unmarked`) in teacher profile to pre-fill roster sheets during attendance marking.
- Each class menu now contains Add Class Advisor option.
- Logout animations, when logout button is clicked it disable all other buttons clicks and opens a Green layer to prevent further clicks.
- Added teacher notes/topic for each class.

### *Security Improvement*
- Centralized rate limiters for sensitive endpoints.
- Created validatePassword checking minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character.
- Added `passwordHistory` field to AdminSchema, TeacherSchema, and StudentSchema. Users are prevented from reusing their last 5 passwords. 
- Optimised Session monitor. Inactivity session timeout and automatic concurrent session termination.
- **New Settings Hub (`settings.html`)**: Centralized 9-tab configuration center covering Institution branding, Pages & Portals, Attendance policies, Feature models, Academic config, Security/Auth rules, Broadcast defaults, Change History, and System Utilities with factory reset.
- **Tri-State Portal Access**: Universal 3-state control (`Enabled`, `Disabled`, `Hidden`) for all portals. Disabled portals display a `🔒 Disabled` badge and reject access with `403 Forbidden`; hidden portals are completely removed from UI and navigation.
- **Change History & Audit Trail**: Real-time immutable logging tracking every setting modification with before/after diffs, author identity, IP, and timestamps.
- **Mandatory Location on Sign-In**: Sign is only allowed when geolocation is accepted, id denied immediate blocking. By enabling this users location is identified for security reasons and attendance marking.

### *Leave & Permission Management*

- Implemented the full end-to-end Student Leave & Permission Management workflow across the Admin, Student, and Teacher portals. Students can choose between Full Day Leave and Half Day Permission (FN - Forenoon / Morning, AN - Afternoon, or custom period range). Period attendance auto-marking will smartly flag students.

### *User Grid Management*
- **Full CRUD & Role-Specific Modal Editing**: Refactored edit modal to align with Admin design standards (`.form-grid`, `.fc2`, `.fl`, `.fg`, `.auto-txt`, `.auto-block`). Full field support across Students (Register No, Department auto-dropdown, Class auto-dropdown, Section, Course Level, Branch, Admission Year, Batch Track ID, Representative flag), Faculty (Employee ID, Department, Designation, Default Attendance Status, Sub-Admin toggle, granular 9-point privilege matrix), and Admins with automatic first/last name splitting.
- **Enhanced Actions Bar with Labeled Buttons**: Expanded action column to 330px with clear, styled text buttons (`✏️ Edit`, `🔑 Password`, `⚡ Deactivate` / `🟢 Activate`, `🔓 Unlock`, `🗑️ Delete`) styled to match Admin action layouts.
- **Status Toggling & Safe Soft-Delete**: Instant inline active/inactive status toggle and custom EAMS small confirmation dialog for deletion capturing pre-deletion snapshots in `M.UndoLog` (Recycle Bin) for 10-day recovery.
- **Attendance Record Audit & Edit**: Complete attendance grid enabling filtering by date range, department, class, and status; in-place attendance status modification (`Present`, `Absent`, `OD`, `Leave`) and period remarks with automatic student attendance counter re-synchronization.

### *Improved Activity Logs Management*
- **Logs Page**: Removed activity logs navigation and implemeneted a new `logs.html` file.
- All logs contains a unique `trackId` for tracking and built with AES-256-GCM Encryption.
- Each log audit is now clickable to open a Detail log information with multiple features.
- `LoginHistorySchema` updated with `location` and `logoutMethod`. 
- Extend LogSchema with logTrackId, encryptedPayload, sessionData, changes, attendanceSummary, actingWithAdminRights, module, subType.
- Login and logout are recorded as one single log entry. When a user logs in, the entry is created. When the user logs out (manual, timeout, or forced), the same log entry is updated with `logoutTime`, `logoutMethod: 'manual'`. 
- One log per student per day. As subsequent periods are marked throughout the day, the existing daily log is updated (updatedAt: new Date()) with the new period statuses.

### *HOD and Principal Logins v1* 
- Implemented HoD and Principal login methods to EAMS. Special features with respective to their role have been added. 

- **HOD**: Teacher role based user with isHod field true. Department-scoped oversight & approvals. Department wise stats and operation are controlled and managed. Access to `controller.html` page and `teacher.html`

- **Principal**: Admin role user with adminFlag: 'principal' → College-wide oversight & institutional governance. Access to `controller.html` page. Overall collage level management. 

- `controller.html` - Dashboard, Attendance Overview, Leave Approvals,  Faculty Overview, Student Directory, Period Records & Teaching Notes, Defaulters Report, Attendance Reports & Analytics, Broadcast Hub, Academic Calendar, Timetable View.

### `Total 90 Files changed and updated in v2.3.1`

## 🔹 `v2.3` — 14 August 2026 *(Frontend Restructure)*

### `Total 63 Files changed and updated in v2.3`

----------------------------------

## 🔹 `v2.2.9` — 18 July 2026 *(Performance Improvement Update)*

### *V1 Changes of Performance Improvement*

- **Frontend (`admin.html`, `teacher.html`)**
    - Dashboard: split init into fast path + deferred widgets (attendance-overview, defaulters, unmarked-teachers) with `AbortController` 8s timeout & per-widget retry.
    - Students: cascade filter (year → batch → dept → class → section), Show List always enabled, default sort by `regNo`, limit=65, client-side live search, column sort triggers server re-fetch.
    - Teachers: dept dropdown uses `_id`, GET filtered by `?deptId=` param.
    - Reports/Analytics: date range gate on all three report generators.
    - Activity Logs: cursor-based pagination (initial 50, Load More via `?before=`), switched to `_logData` array instead of `DB.get('logs')`.
    - Classes/Subjects: `openCD` uses roster mode (`?classId=X&roster=1`), `studentCount` shown from server-side aggregation.
    - ETA: dropped localStorage history persistence; now computed live from current-session task durations.

- **Backend (`routes/*.js`)**
    - `students.routes.js`: response shape changed to `{data, total, page, hasMore}`, academic year format auto-conversion (`2025-2026` → `2025-26`).
    - `logs.routes.js`: sort/filter/cursor uses `createdAt` instead of `time`.
    - `teachers.routes.js`: GET supports `?deptId` (ObjectId) and `?dept` (code).
    - `attendance.routes.js`: filter-required guard + selective student query (only referenced `studentTrackId`s).
    - `dashboard.routes.js`: `/summary` wrapped in try/catch.

- **Database Models (`models/*.js`)**
    - Added 14 indexes across Student, Teacher, Class, Subject, Assignment, Log schemas.
    - TeacherSchema: added `deptId` and `deptCode` fields.
    - LogSchema: added `{createdAt: -1}` index.

- **Migration (`scripts/backfillTeacherDeptId.js`)**
    - One-shot migration that matches `Teacher.department` (case-insensitive) against `Department.name/code/threeLetterCode` and sets `deptId`+`deptCode`.

- **Utilities (`utils/logAction.js`, `start.js`)**
    - `logAction` fixes for new field names.
    - `start.js`: `addTeacher`/`addAdmin`/`addStudent` now create `User` entries; `_demoTeachers` sets `deptId`/`deptCode`; removed `password` from User.create params.

*Still multiple bugs and fixes to be made. Cureently version 1 of improvement is done*
